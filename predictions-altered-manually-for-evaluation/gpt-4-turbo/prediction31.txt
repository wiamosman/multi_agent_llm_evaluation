00 ['Monica Geller']: Hey! @Joy$
01 ['Rachel Green']: Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews? @Surprise$
02 ['Monica Geller']: Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews? @Neutral$
03 ['Rachel Green']: Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me! @Anger$
04 ['Monica Geller']: What, that little thing at the prom? @Neutral$
05 ['Rachel Green']: Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch! @Anger$
06 ['Monica Geller']: Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you? @Neutral$
07 ['Rachel Green']: I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?! @Sadness$
08 ['Monica Geller']: Look, you and I went to different high schools... @Neutral$
09 ['Rachel Green']: Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school. @Neutral$
10 ['Monica Geller']: You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made. @Sadness$
11 ['Rachel Green']: They had to have that specially made?! @Surprise$
12 ['Monica Geller']: It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes. @Neutral$
13 ['Rachel Green']: Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot! @Surprise$
14 ['Rachel Green']: Oh, you go out with him. @Neutral$
15 ['Monica Geller']: Oh, really?! @Surprise$
16 ['Rachel Green']: Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy? @Disgust$
17 ['Monica Geller']: I'll try. @Neutral$
