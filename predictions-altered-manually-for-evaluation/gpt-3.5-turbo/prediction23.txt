00 ['Joey Tribbiani']: But don't you need experience for a job like that? @Neutral$
01 ['Chandler Bing']: It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor. @Joy$
02 ['Scott Alexander']: Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections. @Neutral$
03 ['Chandler Bing']: Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor. @Neutral$
04 ['Scott Alexander']: No kidding. @Surprise$
05 ['Joey Tribbiani']: Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call. @Joy$
06 ['Scott Alexander']: Where do you work? @Neutral$
07 ['Joey Tribbiani']: Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more. @Sadness$
08 ['Chandler Bing']: I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group. @Neutral$
09 ['Scott Alexander']: Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha... @Joy$
10 ['Joey Tribbiani']: Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks? @Disgust$
