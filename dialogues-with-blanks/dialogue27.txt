00 ['David']: ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions. @[BLANK]$
01 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Okay, alright, I have a question, then. @[BLANK]$
02 ['David']: Yuh. @[BLANK]$
03 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Um, were you planning on kissing me ever? @[BLANK]$
04 ['David']: Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you. @[BLANK]$
05 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Sure. @[BLANK]$
06 ['David']: Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella. @[BLANK]$
07 ['David']: Rrrreally. @[BLANK]$
08 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me. @[BLANK]$
09 ['David']: ...Now? Now? @[BLANK]$
10 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Oh yeah, right now. @[BLANK]$
11 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. @[BLANK]$
12 ['David']: Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop? @[BLANK]$
13 ['Phoebe Buffay']: I can hop. @[BLANK]$
