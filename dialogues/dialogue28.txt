00 ['Mr. Ratstatter']: This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo. @Joyful$
01 ['Monica Geller']: So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear. @Neutral$
02 ['Mr. Ratstatter']: Mockolate. @Neutral$
03 ['Monica Geller']: I'm sorry? @Scared$
04 ['Mr. Ratstatter']: Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute. @Neutral$
05 ['Monica Geller']: Ohh. @Scared$
06 ['Mr. Ratstatter']: Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate. @Powerful$
07 ['Monica Geller']: All right. Mmm-mmm. @Mad$
08 ['Mr. Ratstatter']: Yeah? @Neutral$
09 ['Monica Geller']: I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that. @Mad$
10 ['Mr. Ratstatter']: No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you. @Powerful$
11 ['Monica Geller']: Mmm-mmm. @Mad$
12 ['Mr. Ratstatter']: But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday. @Powerful$
13 ['Monica Geller']: Wow. @Neutral$
14 ['Mr. Ratstatter']: Aren't you going to swallow that? @Neutral$
15 ['Monica Geller']: Just waiting for it to stop bubbling. @Mad$
16 ['Mr. Ratstatter']: Yeah, isn't that great? @Powerful$
17 ['Monica Geller']: Mmm. @Mad$
18 ['Monica Geller']: Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate. @Joyful$
19 ['Mr. Ratstatter']: Really? @Powerful$
20 ['Monica Geller']: Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas. @Joyful$
