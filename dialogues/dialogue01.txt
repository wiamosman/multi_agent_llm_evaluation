00 ['Joey Tribbiani']: Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you. @Neutral$
01 ['Chandler Bing']: Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me? @Scared$
02 ['Joey Tribbiani']: 'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project. @Powerful$
03 ['Chandler Bing']: Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that? @Scared$
04 ['Joey Tribbiani']: Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know. @Neutral$
05 ['Joey Tribbiani']: What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph. @Neutral$
06 ['Chandler Bing']: I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up. @Mad$
07 ['Joey Tribbiani']: Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department. @Neutral$
08 ['Chandler Bing']: Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife. @Mad$
09 ['Joey Tribbiani']: Karen. @Neutral$
10 ['Chandler Bing']: Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did. @Powerful$
11 ['Joey Tribbiani']: Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man. @Sad$
12 ['Chandler Bing']: Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer. @Powerful$
13 ['Joey Tribbiani']: Really? @Scared$
14 ['Chandler Bing']: No freakshow, she's fictional. @Mad$
15 ['Joey Tribbiani']: Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else. @Neutral$
16 ['Chandler Bing']: Thank you. @Peaceful$
17 ['Joey Tribbiani']: It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot. @Powerful$
