00 ['David']: ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions. @Powerful$
01 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Okay, alright, I have a question, then. @Neutral$
02 ['David']: Yuh. @Neutral$
03 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Um, were you planning on kissing me ever? @Neutral$
04 ['David']: Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you. @Joyful$
05 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Sure. @Neutral$
06 ['David']: Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella. @Scared$
07 ['David']: Rrrreally. @Neutral$
08 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me. @Joyful$
09 ['David']: ...Now? Now? @Scared$
10 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Oh yeah, right now. @Powerful$
11 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. @Neutral$
12 ['David']: Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop? @Joyful$
13 ['Phoebe Buffay']: I can hop. @Joyful$
