00 ['Chandler Bing']: Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?! @Joyful$
01 ['Joey Tribbiani']: Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you? @Joyful$
02 ['Monica Geller']: Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh? @Joyful$
03 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this! @Joyful$

06 ['Ross Geller']: Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away. @Sad$
07 ['Monica Geller']: Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah! @Joyful$
08 ['Ross Geller']: We were all pretty shaken up about it. @Sad$
09 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way. @Neutral$
10 ['Ross Geller']: Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person. @Neutral$
11 ['Monica Geller']: Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse? @Joyful$

15 ['Joey Tribbiani']: Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse? @Neutral$
16 ['Phoebe Buffay']: No, just a barrel. @Neutral$
17 ['Monica Geller']: Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse. @Joyful$
18 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Really?! Really?! @Joyful$
19 ['Monica Geller']: Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with. @Joyful$
20 ['Chandler Bing']: My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me. @Joyful$
