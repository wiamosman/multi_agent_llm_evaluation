00 ['Rachel Green']: Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies? @Joyful$
01 ['Chandler Bing']: I will have one. @Peaceful$
02 ['Chandler Bing']: Okay, I'm not gonna have one. @Peaceful$
03 ['Ross Geller']: Neither will I. @Peaceful$
04 ['Phoebe Buffay']: No, no, it's just my tooth. @Mad$
05 ['Chandler Bing']: All right I'll have one. @Joyful$
06 ['Phoebe Buffay']: No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him. @Scared$
07 ['Chandler Bing']: See that is the problem with invisible dentists. @Joyful$
08 ['Ross Geller']: Why? Why can't you go to him? @Scared$
09 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies. @Scared$
10 ['Chandler Bing']: That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse. @Scared$
11 ['Rachel Green']: Phoebe, what? Umm...what?! @Scared$
12 ['Rachel Green']: And all these people actually died? @Scared$
13 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives! @Scared$
14 ['Ross Geller']: Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence. @Powerful$
15 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead. @Sad$
