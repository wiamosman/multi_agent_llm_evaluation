I will give you a dialogue from conversation, consisting of multiple lines in the following format:
turn ['Speaker']: utterance @Emotion$

Each line contains a turn number, speaker name, dialogue utterance, and an emotion label such as @Joy$, @Anger$, or @Neutral$.
In the dialogue I provide, all emotion tags will be replaced with the placeholder @[BLANK]$.
Your task is to fill in the correct emotion tag for each utterance using only these 7 labels:
Neutral, Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Surprise.
Do not use emojis in place of the emotion labels. Use only the text-based labels exactly as listed above.

I will give you three example dialogues for training. Do not return the example dialogues or any other text.
Only return the target dialogue between <START> and <END>, with each @[BLANK]$ replaced by your best guess of the appropriate emotion tag.

Example Dialogue 1:
{example_dialogue_1}

Example Dialogue 2:
{example_dialogue_2}

Example Dialogue 3:
{example_dialogue_3}

Here is the dialogue, which I want you to return with blanks filled in:
<START>
{dialogue_with_blanks}
<END>
