Okay! Here are my guesses for the missing emotion tags in the dialogue you provided:

00 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Come in. @Neutral$
01 ['Ryan']: Hey baby, I'm back... @Joyful$
02 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Hey Ryan, what's up? @Sad$
03 ['Ryan']: What's goin' on? @Scared$
04 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox. @Powerful$
05 ['Ryan']: Chicken or small? @Mad$
06 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian. @Sad$
07 ['Ryan']: Why aren't you at home in bed? @Scared$
08 ['Ryan']: I'm sorry, I never had 'em. @Neutral$
09 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Ohh, ohh. @Surprise$
10 ['Ryan']: Can I please see your face? @Scared$
11 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox. @Powerful$
12 ['Ryan']: Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care. @Mad$
13 ['Ryan']: Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely. @Joyful$
14 ['Phoebe Buffay']: I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this. @Sad$
15 ['Phoebe Buffay']: Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had. @Neutral$
