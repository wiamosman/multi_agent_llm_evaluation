I will fill in the blanks with the appropriate emotion tags based on the context of the dialogue:

00 ['Richard Burke']: Monica, wake up. Monica. 😐
01 ['Monica Geller']: What's up? 🤔
02 ['Richard Burke']: I thought of a thing. 💡
03 ['Monica Geller']: Yeah? 👀
04 ['Richard Burke']: Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed. 😴
05 ['Monica Geller']: No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed. 🙄
06 ['Richard Burke']: Or so I would have you believe. 😏
07 ['Monica Geller']: No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed. 🙅‍♀️
08 ['Richard Burke']: Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet. 😜
09 ['Monica Geller']: Alright, go on. 👀
10 ['Richard Burke']: Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side. 🌊
11 ['Monica Geller']: Oh my God, you're a freak. 😂
12 ['Richard Burke']: Yeah. How 'bout that. 😜
