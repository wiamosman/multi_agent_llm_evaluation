Okay, I will fill in the blanks with my best guess for each emotion tag:

00 ['Chandler Bing']: It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time. @Neutral$
01 ['Joanna']: Well, thanks again for lunch. @Joyful$
02 ['Chandler Bing']: Yes, this, this was pleasant. @Powerful$
03 ['Joanna']: It was, wasn't it? @Scared$
04 ['Chandler Bing']: The food there was, was great. @Disgust$
05 ['Joanna']: Wasn't it? @Sadness$
06 ['Chandler Bing']: So take care. @Peaceful$
07 ['Joanna']: You too. @Neutral$
08 ['Chandler Bing']: Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime. @Powerful$
09 ['Joanna']: Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages? @Neutral$
10 ['Rachel Green']: Sophie's desk. @Scared$
11 ['Rachel Green']: Chandler!! Are you gonna call her! @Angry$
12 ['Chandler Bing']: Noo! @Disgust$
13 ['Rachel Green']: Chandler!! @Sadness$
14 ['Chandler Bing']: Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry. @Scared$
15 ['Chandler Bing']: Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you. @Disgust$
16 ['Joanna']: What? @Sadness$
17 ['Joanna']: Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty. @Neutral$
