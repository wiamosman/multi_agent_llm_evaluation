I will fill in the blanks with my best guess for each emotion tag based on the context of the dialogue:

00 ['Joey Tribbiani']: Hey. @Neutral$
01 ['Kate Miller']: Hi. @Peaceful$
02 ['Joey Tribbiani']: So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall? @Powerful$
03 ['Kate Miller']: About what? @Scared$
04 ['Joey Tribbiani']: Y'know, about what happened with us. @Sad$
05 ['Kate Miller']: Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay? @Peaceful$
06 ['Joey Tribbiani']: What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress. @Powerful$
07 ['Lauren']: Hi, Kate! @Joyful$
08 ['Kate Miller']: Hi, Lauren. @Neutral$
09 ['Joey Tribbiani']: Hi, Lauren. @Sad$
10 ['Lauren']: Hi, pig! @Scared$
