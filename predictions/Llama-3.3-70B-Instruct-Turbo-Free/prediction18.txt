00 ['Monica Geller']: Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp. @Neutral$
01 ['Richard Burke']: Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown. @Joy$
02 ['Richard Burke']: Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town? @Neutral$
03 ['Monica Geller']: Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown. @Neutral$
04 ['Richard Burke']: What're you doing? @Neutral$
05 ['Monica Geller']: Just waiting for you sweetie. @Neutral$
06 ['Richard Burke']: Are you remaking the bed? @Surprise$
07 ['Monica Geller']: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine. @Sadness$
08 ['Richard Burke']: Then, you're redoing it because... @Neutral$
09 ['Monica Geller']: If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy. @Fear$
10 ['Richard Burke']: You're pretty much running that risk either way. @Neutral$
11 ['Monica Geller']: Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner. @Neutral$
12 ['Richard Burke']: Oh, well that's not so crazy. @Neutral$
13 ['Monica Geller']: I'm just easing you in. @Neutral$
14 ['Richard Burke']: Oh, alright. @Neutral$
15 ['Monica Geller']: Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you. @Sadness$
16 ['Richard Burke']: Actually, if it's possible, I love you more. @Joy$
17 ['Monica Geller']: Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point. @Joy$
